### Design Choices
1. **Typography**
   - The font families used for this project are 'Poppins' as the primary font and 'Roboto' as the secondary font.
   - Poppins has been selected for all headings of the website. It offers a bold and clear presence, making it ideal for headings, which need to grab the userâ€™s attention immediately.
   - Roboto is used for all body text. It has been chosen for its excellent legibility, especially at smaller sizes. This is critical for ensuring that all textual content remains easily readable on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
2. **Colors**
   - The main colors used for this project are blue and sky blue(the main 2 colors for the flights feature), white, orange, red, black, green, gray and whitesmoke.
   - **Blue** and **sky blue** are the primary colors associated with the flight booking feature, providing a recognizable color identity for this section. **Blue** is used as the background color for the sidebar navigation and for the navigation bar when the scroll position (scrollY) is greater than 0, providing a consistent and dynamic visual identity, as well as the background color for the 'View Details' button of each flight offer. It is also used for heading elements to ensure they stand out and grab attention. **Sky blue** is used for the body text color, offering a soft, readable contrast against the background, and as the background color of the footer to create a distinct, calming section at the bottom of the page. **Sky blue** is also used as the color for loading spinners.
   - **Whitesmoke** is the body's background color in order to create a soft, neutral canvas that reduces eye strain, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience without being too harsh on the eyes.
   - **White** is used for the navigation bar elements (hamburger button, logo, bookmarks and saved flights icons), the main heading of the hero section, footer content, and sidebar navigation links to ensure clarity and a good contrast throughout the website.
   - **Orange** is used as a contrasting accent to the main colors. It serves as the background color for the 'Search' button, drawing attention to this key action. In the main heading **orange** is applied to the text "Fly Your Dreams," emphasizing the key message and adding visual interest to the heading.
   - **Red** is used as a background color for key action buttons, including the "Clear" button next to input fields for departure/arrival locations or calendar selections, ensuring it's easily noticeable for users to reset their choices. It is also applied to the "Save" button for each flight offer and the "Close" button in the flight details dialog, drawing attention to these important interactive elements and enhancing the overall usability of the site.
   - **Black** is used for key textual elements, including the departure and arrival hours in the flight offers, providing strong contrast for readability. It is also applied to the headings and content within the flight details dialog.
   - **Green** is used to highlight the cabin class and label the included features within the flight details dialog, providing a clear and visually appealing way to draw attention to important information and enhancing the overall user experience.
   - **Gray** is primarily used as a hover color for the footer social media buttons and for the sorting buttons (best, cheapest, fastest) on the flight results page, providing a subtle visual cue that enhances interactivity without overwhelming the design.
3. **Navigation**
   - The following aspects were taken into consideration for designing the navigation bar to ensure the user has a smooth experience on navigating the website:
     - **Background Color:** The navigation bar features a blue background color, which aligns with the overall color scheme of the site and ensures consistency with the flight booking section. This color also helps the navigation stand out while maintaining a clean and professional look.
     - **Fixed Position:** The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the screen, remaining visible as the user scrolls. This ensures quick access to important site sections, enhancing usability and improving user experience by keeping navigation options readily available at all times.
4. **Footer**
   - The footer has a sky blue background color, offering a soft contrast to the rest of the page while creating a distinct section at the bottom.
   - The text within the footer is white, ensuring high contrast and readability against the sky blue background, making important information easy to find and read.
5. **Layout**
   - The core functionality of the website is showcased in the hero section where users are immediately presented with the most important features like flight search and calls to action.
   - The most modern CSS layout techniques were used to build the website, including CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid and the [Bootstrap Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#example).
6. **Images**
   - All images are carefully selected and of high quality. The images were optimised using [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com/image-compressor) as image compressor.
   - The hero background image was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and highlights the main feature of the website.
7. **Modals**
   - The website includes modals for displaying detailed flight information and for the flight booking form, both of which are created using the `<dialog>` element. This choice allows for efficient and accessible modal management, leveraging built-in methods for displaying and hiding the modals.
   - The `<dialog>` element provides convenient built-in methods such as `.showModal()` and `.close()`, making it easier to control the visibility of the modals using JavaScript.
   - The `<dialog>` element enhances accessibility by providing a semantic way to define modals. This helps ensure that the modals are properly recognized by screen readers and other assistive technologies, improving the overall user experience for all users, including those with disabilities.
   - More about the `<dialog>` element on [MDN dialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog).
8. **Cards**
   - The services section utilizes [Bootstrap's Card Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/#about) to present key features of the site. Each service is displayed in its own dedicated card, providing a visually structured and user-friendly way to highlight these unique selling points.
9. **Responsive Design**
    - The content adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes and devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.
### Wireframes 
For this project, I decided to create high-fidelity wireframes to better visualize the final product. High-fidelity wireframes provide a more detailed representation of the design compared to low-fidelity wireframes.

## Technologies Used
1. **HTML5** - The foundational markup language for structuring web content.
2. **CSS3** - Used for styling and layout, enhancing the visual appearance of the project.
3. **Bootstrap 5** - Used for creating responsiveness across all screen sizes, pre-designed components and utility classes. More about Bootstrap on the [official Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/).
4. **JavaScript** - It is used to handle user interactions, manipulate the DOM, and manage application logic.
5. **Tippy.js** - Tippy.js is a lightweight and highly customizable library for creating tooltips and popovers in web applications. More about Tippy.js on the [official website](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/).
6. **Air-datepicker** - Air-datepicker is a simple and flexible date-picker library that makes it easy for users to select dates. More about Air-datepicker on the [official website](https://air-datepicker.com/).
7. **Parcel.js** - Parcel.js is a fast, zero-config web application bundler. It simplifies the development process by automatically handling tasks such as bundling JavaScript, CSS and assets. More about Parcel.js on the [official website](https://parceljs.org/).
8. **Babel** (included in Parcel.js by default) - Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest ECMAScript features by converting modern JavaScript (ES6) into a version compatible with older browsers and environments. Babel can only transpile ES6 syntax(e.g. arrow functions, classes, const). The same is not true for new features like new array methods (e.g. find) or promises, but here is where polyfilling comes into play. More about Babel on the [official website](https://babeljs.io/).
9. **Core.js** (integrated with Babel) - Core.js is a powerful JavaScript library that provides polyfills for ECMAScript features, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and environments. More about Core.js on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js).
10. **Regenerator-runtime** - The Regenerator-runtime library provides a runtime for generators and async functions, enabling the use of modern asynchronous JavaScript syntax (like async/await) in environments that do not natively support it. More about the Regenerator-runtime [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regenerator-runtime).
11. **Booking API** - The Booking API focuses on flight-related services. It provides real-time data on arrival and departure locations, flight dates and available flight offers. The API allows users to search for flights and view flight options.
12. **Intersection Observer API** - The Intersection Observer API is a web API that allows you to monitor the visibility and position of elements within a viewport or container. It provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of an element with a parent element or the viewport, without needing to manually track scroll events. This API is commonly used for implementing features like infinite scrolling, lazy loading images, and triggering animations when elements come into view. More about the Intersection Observer API [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
13. **Intl** - The Intl API (Internationalization API) is a built-in JavaScript API that provides a set of functions and objects for handling language-sensitive operations. It helps developers build web applications that can adapt to various languages, formats, and cultural conventions. More about Intl [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl).
## Deployment
This project was created using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), committed to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) using Git's built-in function `git push`.
As this project was created using the development environment provided by [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/), I decided to deploy it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as the deployment process was much easier. The next steps were followed:
1. **Build the Project**
   - After the development process, I made sure the project is built for production by running the following command in the terminal: `npm run build`
   - This will generate the production-ready files inside the `dist/` folder (or the configured output folder).

#### MacOS
**Follow the first 10 steps from Windows instructions above**

**Important Note**
As this project was built on a Windows, trying to run it on macOS might cause additional issues. It's possible that the `node_modules` directory still has the Windows-specific version of other platform-specific dependencies that aren't compatible with macOS. (e.g Parcel.js uses [Lightningcss](https://lightningcss.dev/) for CSS minification and optimization. This can cause an error on macOS when running a project that was built on Windows). To solve this issue, follow the next steps:
- **Delete `package-lock.json` (if it exists):** If you still have the `package-lock.json` file in your project, it may contain platform-specific dependencies from the previous Windows environment. Itâ€™s a good practice to delete this file before reinstalling dependencies to avoid platform-specific conflicts. Run `rm package-lock.json` in your command line or delete the file manually.
- **Install dependencies on macOS:** Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies fresh on your macOS machine. This will ensure that the right versions of all packages for macOS are installed. The packages will be installed based on your system's platform and architecture, and any platform-specific versions of dependencies (like Lightningcss) will be installed correctly for macOS.
- **Verify the installation:** Once the dependencies are installed, you can verify that everything is working correctly by running `npm start`.
**After completing the steps above, you can follow the rest of the steps from Windows instructions**
